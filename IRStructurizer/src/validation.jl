    validate_scf(sci::StructuredCodeInfo) -> Bool

Validate that all control flow in the original CodeInfo has been properly
converted to structured control flow operations (ControlFlowOp).

Throws `UnstructuredControlFlowError` if unstructured control flow remains.
Returns `true` if all control flow is properly structured.

The invariant is simple: no expression in any `block.body` should be a
`GotoNode` or `GotoIfNot` - those should have been replaced by
structured ops that the visitor descends into.
